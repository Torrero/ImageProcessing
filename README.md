# ImageProcessing
Image processing, Triangulation, Delone, 
This program is used for detection cloudiness on remote sensing images. Application was developed with using .Net framework on language C#. In this application are used such algorithms:  Quadtree for segmentation objects and triangulation of Delone with KD-tree for calculation of geometric concentration of object.
